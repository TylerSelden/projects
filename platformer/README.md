# JS2D Game Engine Demo
**A demonstration of my JS2D's capabilities**

Last year, I decided that I wanted to make a video game. I didn't get very far, but I did manage to write a game engine that runs without any dependencies (e.g. React, JQuery), that supported top-down and platformer games. This was the quick demo I threw together for testing. The entire engine is contained inside the `engine.js` file, un-obfuscated.
