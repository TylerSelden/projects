# Pain Game
**A game to suffer with your friends :)**

I created the Pain Game one morning a few years ago, mostly as a joke. Basically it takes a random verb, subject, and time limit and puts them together into a sentence. Players basically take turns clicking the "pain" button, and are told by the game to do random things. There's a 1 in 75 chance that, when the pain button gets clicked, that player wins, ending the game for everybody.
