# Stock Market Game
**A (very fun) multiplayer stock market simulation**

This is probably my most successful project. Essentially, it's a multiplayer simulation of a Stock Market.

- There are different companies with different parameters and attributes. For example, some have small price ranges, and their prices change less rapidly, making them safer (but slower) investments.
- You can buy shares when their prices are low, and sell when they're high, gaining profit.
- There's only so many shares per company, so you have to be watching closely and buy before they're sold out.
- The prices update every minute, and change by small, random incrememts.
- You can see what players are online and currently playing, and who's not.
- Players can send money to other players in the form of gifts.
